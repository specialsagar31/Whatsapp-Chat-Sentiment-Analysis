03/12/21, 12:10 - Pranay Subk: @918979885445 : Be blunt in talking about Datakind. We spend considerable hours (at least 40 hours) in telling about our business. It has resulted in zero RoI

06/12/21, 11:45 - Naveen Data Analyst Sub-K: In this paper they also included std devn of payment times in addition to r f and m so i think we also can include that in our model because it is adding new additional information which not included in in rfm
